<h1 id="Why-DNS-uses-the-UDP-protocol"><a href="#Why-DNS-uses-the-UDP-protocol" class="headerlink" title="Why DNS uses the UDP protocol?"></a>Why DNS uses the UDP protocol?</h1><p>The specific problem we are analyzing today is “Why DNS uses the UDP protocol”. DNS is the phone book of the entire Internet, and it translates human-understandable domain names into machine-understandable IP addresses so that Internet users no longer need to directly contact IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand. The author has previously described the principles of DNS implementation in the article Detailing the Implementation of DNS and CoreDNS, so this article will not cover the principles of DNS implementation, for those interested.</p>
<p>I believe that DNS uses UDP protocol has become common knowledge among software engineers, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS will use UDP protocol to transfer data, but this view is not entirely correct. We hope to help you understand the full picture of the DNS protocol.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>The two questions we will discuss are not conflicting. In most cases, DNS uses the UDP protocol to communicate, and the DNS protocol was designed to recommend that we use UDP first for domain name resolution, which does solve many needs, but not all.</p>
<p>DNS uses not only the UDP protocol, but also the TCP protocol, but before we get into the specifics of today’s issue, we’d like to give a brief introduction to the DNS protocol: the types of DNS queries include not only common queries such as A records and CNAME records, but also special queries of the AXFR type, which are mainly used for DNS zone transfers, and which serve to It is used to quickly migrate records between multiple nameservers, and since the response returned by the query is relatively large, the TCP protocol is used to transfer the packets.</p>
<p>As a widely used protocol, we can find many DNS-related RFC documents, and the DNS Camel Viewer lists nearly 300 RFC documents related to the DNS protocol, of which 6 are current Internet standards and 102 are DNS-related proposals, which together constitute our current understanding of the design of the DNS protocol, and the authors There is no way for the author to read the contents of each of them, but only some of the important documents are selected to help us understand the history of DNS and its relationship with UDP/TCP protocols.</p>
<p>RFC1034 - Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities Internet Standard, 1987-11<br>(a) DNS queries can be transmitted via UDP packets or TCP connections.<br>Because the DNS zone transfer function has a strong need for accurate data, we must use TCP or other reliable protocols for AXFR-type requests.<br>RFC1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification<br>(a) The Internet supports access by nameservers over TCP or UDP protocols.<br>The UDP protocol should not carry more than 512 bytes of messages; messages that exceed this are truncated and set the TC bit of the DNS protocol; the UDP protocol is not acceptable for zone transfer functions, but is the recommended protocol for standard queries on the Internet. Queries sent over the UDP protocol may be lost, so retransmission policies are needed to address this issue.<br>RFC1123 - Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support Internet Standard, 1989-10<br>new DNS record types defined in the future may contain more than 512 bytes of information, so we should use the TCP protocol to transfer DNS records; therefore resolvers and naming services need to use the TCP protocol as a backup if UDP cannot meet the demand.<br>DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support the UDP protocol and SHOULD support sending non-zone-transfer queries using the TCP protocol; that is, a DNS resolver or server sending a non-zone-transfer query MUST first send a UDP query, and if the response to that query is truncated, it SHOULD attempt to re-request using the TCP protocol.<br>RFC3596 - DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6 Internet Standard, 2003-10<br>support for the IPv6 protocol through DNS extensions, each of which occupies 16 bytes four times the size of IPv4.<br>RFC5011 - Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors Independent, 2007-10<br>The addition of multiple resource records to authenticate the source of DNS data for DNS clients, with records often containing larger data.<br>RFC6376 - DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures Internet Standard, 2011-09<br>Choosing the appropriate key size for encryption is a trade-off between cost, performance, and risk; however, large keys (4096-bit) may not have a way to be placed directly into the DNS UDP response packet and returned directly.<br>RFC6891 - Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) Internet Standard, 2013-04<br>DNS queries and responses transmitted using UDP cannot exceed a maximum of 512 bytes and cannot support the transmission of large numbers of records such as IPv6 addresses or DNS security signatures.<br>EDNS provides an extension for DNS to carry up to 4096 bytes of data over the UDP protocol.<br>RFC7766 - DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements Proposed Standard, 2016-03<br>when a client receives a truncated DNS response, it should determine via the TC field whether it needs to repeat the DNS query request over the TCP protocol.<br>The introduction of DNSSEC has made truncated UDP packets very common.<br>(b) Packet sizes exceeding the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for DNS transport using UDP may lead to fragmentation of IP packets, and the future predicted in the RFC1123 document has arrived where the only EDNS mechanism for increasing the packet size that UDP can carry is not considered reliable enough.<br>(b) All generic DNS implementations must support both UDP and TCP transport protocols, which include authoritative servers, recursive servers, and staked resolvers.<br>Stake resolvers and recursive resolvers may choose to use TCP or UDP queries to request the target server directly, as appropriate; it is no longer mandatory to initiate DNS requests with the UDP protocol, and the TCP and UDP protocols may be substituted for each other in DNS queries rather than as a retry mechanism.<br>Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS) Proposed Standard, 2016-05<br>The introduction of TLS into the DNS protocol to provide privacy for users and reduce eavesdropping and tampering with DNS queries, but the introduction of the TLS protocol introduces some additional performance overhead.<br>RFC8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH) Proposed Standard, 2018-10<br>defines a protocol for sending DNS queries and obtaining DNS responses over HTTPS.<br>We can briefly summarize the history of DNS. RFC1034 and RFC1035 in 1987 defined the original version of the DNS protocol, which was just designed to use both UDP and TCP protocols, and for the majority of DNS queries will use UDP datagrams for transmission, and TCP protocol will only be used in zone transmission scenarios, where The RFC1123 released two years later predicted that more and more data would be stored in DNS records, and for the first time explicitly stated that UDP packets should be retried over TCP if they were found to be truncated.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 years later, as the Internet grew, it was discovered that IPv4 was no longer sufficient for allocation, so the longer IPv6 was introduced and DNS was supported in the 2003 RFC3596 release; the subsequent RFC5011 and RFC6376 releases added support for authentication and security, but also created a huge DNS record. UDP packet truncation became very common.</p>
<p>The DNS extensions provided by RFC6891 helped to address the problem of truncated large packets to some extent, reducing the need for retries using the TCP protocol, but this did not solve all the problems due to the maximum transmission unit limit.</p>
<p>It was more than 30 years after the advent of DNS that RFC7766 finally proposed the use of TCP as the primary protocol to solve problems that UDP could not, and TCP was no longer just a mechanism to be used for retries.</p>
<p>From this development, DNS does not only use UDP packets for a communication, but also the TCP protocol has been seen in the DNS standard, and we would like to analyze it today from a historical perspective - “why DNS queries choose to use UDP/TCP protocol”.</p>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>In this section, we will introduce the advantages and disadvantages of UDP and TCP protocols in supporting DNS queries and responses in two parts, depending on the protocols used for DNS.</p>
<h2 id="UDP"><a href="#UDP" class="headerlink" title="UDP"></a>UDP</h2><p>The UDP protocol has been the primary protocol used by DNS for decades, and as a standard for the Internet, the majority of DNS requests and responses now use the UDP protocol for data transmission, and we can easily obtain DNS requests and responses using the UDP protocol as a carrier through packet capture tools.</p>
<p>The data of DNS requests are encapsulated in binary form in the UDP packet shown below. The following is a request to call a DNS server to obtain the IP address of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.baidu.com/">www.baidu.com</a> domain, starting from byte 05 in the fourth line to the end is the content of the DNS request. UDP protocol headers.</p>

<p>Although each UDP packet contains a lot of Ethernet, IP, UDP, and DNS protocol-related content, the DNS request above is only 73 bytes in size, and the response to the above DNS request is only 132 bytes, which is a very small packet for other common requests today: 0000 38 f9 d3 ce</p>

<p>As a reliable transport protocol, TCP requires three handshakes to establish a TCP connection between the two communicating parties before they can communicate, but in the 30-year-old DNS query scenario we don’t really need a stable connection (or think we don’t). The packets for common DNS queries are very small, and TCP connection establishment introduces the following additional overhead.</p>
<p>TCP connection establishment requires three network communications.<br>TCP connection establishment requires ~130 bytes of data to be transferred.<br>four network communications required for TCP to destroy the connection.<br>~160 bytes of data to be transferred for TCP to destroy the connection.<br>Assuming that the time consumed by network communication is negligible, if we consider only the data transferred when TCP establishes a connection, we can do a simple calculation.</p>
<p>Using TCP protocol (330 bytes total)<br>Three handshakes - 14x3(Ethernet) + 20x3(IP) + 44 + 44 + 32(TCP) bytes<br>Query Protocol Header - 14(Ethernet) + 20(IP) + 20(TCP) bytes<br>Response protocol header - 14(Ethernet) + 20(IP) + 20(TCP) bytes<br>Use UDP protocol (84 bytes total)<br>Query Protocol Header - 14(Ethernet) + 20(IP) + 8(UDP) bytes<br>Response protocol header - 14(Ethernet) + 20(IP) + 8(UDP) bytes<br>Note 1: The TCP header overhead is specific to the request and environment, and the exact result may fluctuate slightly, with a size of about 120 bytes.</p>
<p>Note 2: We calculate the results here on the assumption that the DNS resolver only needs to communicate with one nameserver or authoritative server to obtain a DNS response, but in a real-world scenario, the DNS resolver may recursively communicate with multiple nameservers, which doubly magnifies the disadvantage of the TCP protocol in terms of additional overhead.</p>
<p>If the request body and response of a DNS query are 15 and 70 bytes, respectively, TCP adds ~250 bytes and ~145% additional overhead compared to UDP. The time cost of multiple communications and message transfers cannot be ignored when DNS queries are small, and the reliability of TCP connections does not play a large role in the DNS scenario.</p>
<h2 id="TCP"><a href="#TCP" class="headerlink" title="TCP"></a>TCP</h2><p>Today’s network situation is not as simple as it was designed decades ago. Not only are we experiencing the imminent unavailability of IPv4, but we also need to introduce mechanisms such as DNSSEC to ensure the integrity of DNS queries and requests, as well as transmission security. Why do we have to use the TCP protocol when more data needs to be transferred? If we continue to use the UDP protocol, can’t we do DNS resolution.</p>
<p>In theory, the size of a UDP packet can reach up to 64KB, which is actually a very large value for a common DNS query; however, in practice, once the data in a packet exceeds the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the transmission link, which is generally 1500 bytes, the current packet may be fragmented and dropped. Some network devices may even refuse to process requests that contain the EDNS(0) option, which can lead to DNS instability using the UDP protocol.</p>
<p>TCP, as a reliable transport protocol, can solve this problem very well. Through the mechanism of sequence number and retransmission, we can ensure that the message is not heavy or missing, and the TCP stack of the message recipient will reassemble the fragmented data, and the DNS and other application layer protocols can directly use the processed complete data. At the same time, when the packet is large enough, the percentage of additional overhead from the three TCP handshakes becomes smaller and smaller, converging to zero compared to the size of the entire packet.</p>
<p>When the DNS packet size is 500 bytes, the additional overhead of the TCP protocol is ~41.2%.<br>When the DNS packet size is 1100 bytes, the additional overhead of the TCP protocol is ~20.7%.<br>~10.3% additional overhead for the TCP protocol when the DNS packet size is 2300 bytes.<br>~5.0% additional overhead for the TCP protocol when the DNS packet size is 4800 bytes.</p>
<p>So, when we store more content in DNS, the additional overhead of TCP triple handshake and protocol headers is not a critical factor, but there is no way to avoid the three network transmission times caused by our TCP triple handshake, which is a problem we have to accept in the current scenario.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Many people believe that DNS uses the UDP protocol to obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name, this view is correct, but still has some one-sided, more accurate is actually the DNS query when first designed to use the UDP protocol for communication, while the TCP protocol is also in the evolution and development of DNS was added to the specification of.</p>
<p>The DNS was designed to introduce the TCP protocol in zone transfers and use the UDP protocol in queries.<br>When DNS exceeded the 512-byte limit, we first specified in the DNS protocol the specification that “when a DNS query is truncated, it should be retried using the TCP protocol”.<br>The subsequent introduction of EDNS allowed us to use UDP to transfer up to 4096 bytes of data, but this was not reliable due to data fragmentation and loss due to MTU limitations.<br>In recent years, we have re-specified that DNS should support both UDP and TCP protocols, and that TCP is no longer only an option for retries.</p>
